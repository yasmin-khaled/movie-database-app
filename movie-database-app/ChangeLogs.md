Changes are mainly for setting up the project:

Create a React project and name it movie-database-app.
Install dependencies like Tailwind CSS and Jest.
Configure CSS by modifying tailwind.config.css and index.css.
Configure Jest by modifying package.json.
Create a folder for components and another folder that will include the test files.
